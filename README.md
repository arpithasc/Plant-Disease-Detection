# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection System 🍂🧪

A deep learning-powered application that detects plant diseases from leaf images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system helps farmers and agricultural experts quickly identify crop health issues and take timely action.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to automate the detection of plant diseases by:
- Taking an image of a plant leaf
- Preprocessing and feeding it to a trained CNN model
- Predicting the disease class or confirming the plant is healthy

## 💡 Features

- 📷 Upload or capture leaf images
- 🤖 CNN-based disease classification
- 🔍 Supports multiple plant species and diseases
- 💻 Simple and intuitive web interface (Streamlit)
- 📊 Display of prediction confidence and disease description

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – deep learning model
- **OpenCV** – image preprocessing
- **Streamlit** – interactive web UI
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib** – data handling and visualization

## 🌾 Supported Plant Types & Diseases
Tomato: Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Mold

Potato: Early Blight, Late Blight

Pepper: Bacterial Spot

Corn: Common Rust, Gray Leaf Spot

Apple: Scab, Black Rot, Cedar Apple Rust
