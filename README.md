## Code

The `code.pdf` file contains the Python scripts used in this project. This includes code for:
* Mounting Google Drive and accessing the dataset.
* Organizing and preprocessing the image data.
* Building and training a deep learning model (likely using a CNN architecture).
* Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
* Making predictions on sample images.
