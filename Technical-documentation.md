## Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

## 1. Introduction

The Plant Disease Detection project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to identify plant diseases from images of leaves. Agricultural productivity is often compromised due to undiagnosed or misdiagnosed plant diseases, particularly in rural areas lacking expert access. This system provides an image-based diagnostic tool that automates the identification process using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), offering a scalable and cost-effective solution.


## 2. Problem Statement

Traditional disease detection methods rely on manual inspection or consultation with agricultural experts. These approaches are time-consuming, often inaccurate, and not readily available in remote regions. An automated, AI-driven method that classifies plant diseases from visual symptoms can address this challenge effectively.


## 3. Objective

To design, develop, and evaluate a deep learning-based model capable of:
	•	Classifying multiple types of plant leaf diseases with high accuracy.
	•	Accepting raw images as input without the need for expert preprocessing.
	•	Supporting integration into mobile or web-based platforms for real-world deployment.


## 4. Dataset

Source: PlantVillage Dataset
Content: 50,000+ labeled images across 14 crop species and 38 disease categories, including:
	•	Apple Scab
	•	Tomato Mosaic Virus
	•	Corn Leaf Blight
	•	Healthy Leaves 

Preprocessing Techniques:
	•	Image resizing to 224x224 pixels
	•	Normalization and augmentation (rotation, flipping)
	•	Color correction and noise reduction (OpenCV)

## 5. System Architecture
Component               Description
Input Module            Accepts leaf image from user or image directory
Preprocessing           Enhances image quality using OpenCV for consistent input characteristics
CNN Model               Classifies image into disease category based on trained features
Output Module           Displays predicted disease name and confidence score

## 6. Model Architecture
	•	Model Type: Convolutional Neural Network
	•	Framework: Keras with TensorFlow backend
	•	Layers:
	•	Input Layer 
	•	Convolutional Layers with ReLU activation

	•	Integration Potential:
	•	Web applications for agricultural extension platforms
	•	Android-based apps for field use
	•	Offline Support: Model size optimized for low-bandwidth environments


## 8. Key Features
	•	Multi class image classification of leaf diseases
	•	Lightweight and scalable for rural deployment
	•	Minimal preprocessing required
	•	Modular design for easy updates or retraining


## 9. Limitations & Future Scope
